## 🚀 Mini GitHub – DevOps Source Code Management Project

This project demonstrates how Git & GitHub are used in real-world software development for version control, collaboration, and code history tracking.
The goal is to simulate how developers work in teams by managing code, creating branches, handling conflicts, and pushing updates to a remote repository.
To represent changes, a webpage (index.html) is created and modified across multiple branches. Each commit reflects a version update — just like real projects in industry.

## 📄 Project Overview

During development, code evolves through multiple updates. Git helps track these updates, store versions, and collaborate without losing code.
In this project:

A Git repository is created locally

A webpage is developed and versioned using Git

Multiple feature branches are created

Merging is performed with conflict resolution

Code is pushed to GitHub for remote backup & sharing

This project helped me understand the core Git workflow used in DevOps pipelines.

## ✨ Features Implemented in This Project

Feature	Description
Git Initialization	Started a repository using git init
Version Tracking	Tracked changes & maintained code versions using commits
Branching Strategy	Created feature, test, bugfix, and experiment branches
Merge Operations	Merged branches into master like real deployment workflow
Merge Conflict Handling	Conflict was created intentionally and resolved manually
Remote Repository Setup	Linked local repo to GitHub using git remote add origin
Push to GitHub	Uploaded final work for sharing & backup
READme Documentation	Explained usage, commands, workflow & screenshots
🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
Tool/Tech	Purpose in Project
Git	Version control, branching, merging
GitHub	Remote repository hosting & collaboration
Git Bash	Terminal for executing Git commands
HTML + CSS	Web UI file for testing Git workflow
Windows/Linux	Practical execution of DevOps environment

## 📌 Complete Workflow Followed
1. Created project folder  
2. Initialized Git repository  
3. Created `index.html` and wrote webpage code  
4. Staged and committed changes  
5. Created multiple branches for different tasks  
6. Updated code separately inside branches  
7. Performed merging back into master  
8. Encountered merge conflict → resolved manually  
9. Added GitHub remote link  
10. Pushed final code to GitHub 

## 🧪 Git Commands Used (With Purpose)

git init # Initialize repository
git status # Check working directory changes
git add . # Stage all files
git commit -m "message" # Commit staged changes
git branch # List branches
git branch <name> # Create branch
git checkout <name> # Switch branch
git merge <name> # Merge branch into current branch
git log --oneline # View commit history in short form
git diff # Show file differences
git remote add origin <URL> # Connect to GitHub
git push -u origin master # Upload code to remote repo


## 🎯 Final Outcome
A working Git repository demonstrating:

- Version control
- Code history management
- Branching & merging
- Conflict resolution
- Remote hosting on GitHub
